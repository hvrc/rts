word pre-validation:

checks if word is empty
checks if word starts with r, t, or s
checks if word was used before in game history
checks if word is the same as last word
checks if word contains or is contained within last word (including plurals/variations)

word relationship search:

finds max n words with closest wordnet path similarity
finds max n child words (hyponyms - "poodle is a type of dog")
finds max n parent words (hypernyms - "dog is a type of animal")
finds max m sister words for each parent (other types of the same parent - "cat and dog are types of pet")
finds max n synonyms (from wordnet lemmas)

word filtering:

removes words starting with r, t, or s
removes words containing underscores or non-alphabetic characters
removes words used previously in game
removes words that are substrings of previous word or vice versa
removes words that are not nouns or adjectives

word scoring and ranking (in priority order):

wordnet path similarity score (highest weight)
hyponym relationship score
hypernym relationship score
sister term similarity score
word frequency/commonness score (from predefined common words list)

concreteness score based on:
word appears in concrete indicators list
word's hypernyms connect to concrete root concepts
word's definition doesn't contain abstract keywords

selection and validation:

returns highest scoring valid word

additional validation:

verifies final similarity score meets minimum threshold (0.2)
for sister terms, checks minimum similarity threshold (0.5)
ensures selected word has proper semantic relation to input word
verifies word exists in wordnet dictionary as a noun
stores reason for relationship
updates game state with new word
